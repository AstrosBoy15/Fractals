# Fractals
This project visualizes the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set>Mandelbrot set</a> and the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julia_set>Julia set</a>. Both of these sets are governed by the equation $f(z)=z^2+c$. This function is complex-valued, where c is some arbitrary complex number. The Mandelbrot set is visualized by recursively evaluating $f(z)$ at $z=0$, where each pixel's position on the screen is used as the complex value for c. The set is then visualized as black for initial points that converge to a finite value. Every other point is assigned a gradiation based off of how many iterations it took for the recursive function to diverge. The Julia set starts with the same function, $f(z)$. However, this time the value of c is fixed and each pixel's position represents the initial value of z to use in the recursive formula.

## Usage
The visualization can be found <a href=https://github.com/AstrosBoy15/Fractals/releases/tag/Release>here</a>. The project can be run via the Fractals.exe file. Within the visualization, using WASD will navigate around the image, using E and Q will zoom in and out, and using R will reset the viewport. The visualization can be flipped between the Mandelbrot set and the Julia set via the GUI panel. The number of iterations and the value of c (Julia set only) can also be changed from the GUI.

## Project Details
This project was done in December of 2021. It uses C++ with OpenGL for rendering the graphics to the screen. A fragement shader is used to recursively evaluate the function and to determine what color each pixel should output, based on the recursion's result. <a href=https://github.com/ocornut/imgui>Dear ImGUI</a> was used to display the GUI options. This project was inspired by two videos done by the YouTube channel <a href=https://www.youtube.com/@3blue1brown>3Blue1Brown</a>. These videos can be found <a href=https://youtu.be/-RdOwhmqP5s>here</a> and <a href=https://youtu.be/LqbZpur38nw>here</a>.

## Future Work
This visualization loses accuracy as the user zooms in, until it eventually shows individual pixels and detail is lost. This is likely caused by roundoff error. Increasing resolution at these micro levels will greatly improve the visualization. Implementing a <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton_fractal>Newton Fractal</a> visualization is a natural extension of this visualization. It recursively uses Newton's Method to determine the root that an initial value will converge to.
